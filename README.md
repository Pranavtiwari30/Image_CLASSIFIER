# Image_CLASSIFIER
CIFAR-10 Image Classifier 

This project is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset into 10 distinct categories: Plane, Car, Bird, Cat, Deer, Dog, Frog, Horse, Ship, and Truck. The model is implemented using Python and TensorFlow/Keras and includes a feature to predict classes of custom images.

Features

Dataset: CIFAR-10, containing 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes.

Model Architecture:

Three convolutional layers with ReLU activation.

Max-pooling layers to reduce spatial dimensions.

Dense layers with a softmax output for classification.

Custom Image Prediction: Load and classify external images (e.g., horse.jpg).

Visualization: Plots the first 16 training images with their respective class names.

Project Structure

cifar10_image_classifier.py: Main Python script containing the model implementation and training process.

horse.jpg: Example custom image to test predictions.

image_classifier.model: Saved model file after training.

Setup Instructions

Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.8 or later

TensorFlow 2.x

OpenCV

NumPy

Matplotlib

Installation

Clone this repository:

git clone 

Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage

Training the Model
Run the script to train the model:

python cifar10_image_classifier.py

This will train the CNN on the CIFAR-10 dataset and save the trained model as image_classifier.model.

Testing with Custom Images
Replace horse.jpg with your own image file, ensuring itâ€™s resized to 32x32 pixels. The model will predict the class of the image.

Model Performance

The model is trained on a reduced dataset (20,000 images for training and 4,000 for testing) for faster testing. Evaluate its performance using the CIFAR-10 test set:

To Do

Train the model on the full CIFAR-10 dataset for better accuracy.

Enhance the model by adding data augmentation.

Optimize hyperparameters for improved performance.
